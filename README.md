#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
kickerstarter analysis for excel intro week 1
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project was to analyze the Web-scraped Kickstarter data to help gain insights for our client Louise. In this analysis, we pinpointed specific outcomes for Campaigns in which Louise was interested. We cleaned the data, formatted the data, added statistical measures and charts to better help her visualize kickstarter outcomes, more specifically Theatre outcomes. 
### Purpose
Our purpose in this was to help Louise Vizualize the kickstarter data. On one of the many things we did was give her deeper insights on campaign outcomes based on initial goals as well as the speed of funding for her project type (Theatre). 
## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis provided shows specifc insights for campaign outcomes for Louises domain of theatre.

You can find the dataset as well as the analysis in the following github link:https://github.com/dbrunik2019/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
You can see the chart here: https://github.com/dbrunik2019/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Theatre_outcomes_vs_Launch.png.png
Comments: We can conlucde here that Theatre campaigns had 839 successful outcomes, of which, May had the most number of successuful. There were 493 Failed campigns, and 37 canceled. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
https://github.com/dbrunik2019/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Outcomes_Vs_Goals.png
Goals with a target amount of less than 1000 had the highest success percentage (70.08%). Generally speaking, the lower the goal, the higher probability of meeting the funding. If the project set a goal on the the higher end of the range spectrum, it was more likly to fail. this is indicated by the slope increase in the orange line on the chart. There is a convergence at 15000-19999, 30000-34999, and 40000-44999 in which there is roughly an equal % of success and failure. Knowing this insight, with equal percentage outcomes, if you do not want to se a lower goal to secure a higher probability of funding, and you have the risk tolerance, you should go for the 40000-44999 range becuase that indicates roughly similar (slighly lower probablity) chance outcomes with a much higher goal  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Learning syntax as well as formatting charts was somewhat of a challenge, but we pushed through by asking good questions.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
2 conclusions for theatre outcomes by launch date: May had the most successful theatre campaigns, and the overal ratio % of successful theatre campigns was 61.3%.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
goals of 50000 or more had the highest failure rate, and lowest success rate, at 58.11 and 19.37 respectivly.  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This crowdfunding data is inherently limited becuase it is only from kickstarter. There are other crowdfudning sights that you could analyze to gain deeper insights into the outcomes and realities of crowding as a whole. this would present new challenges in formatting data from different websites. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Average Donation by category and subcategroy. Also, Percentage of succesful campaights for those that are staff picks and those that are not. As well as a deper country analysis.
